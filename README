== Ruby Interface to XTF
    
=== Summary

XTF-Ruby brings a Ruby interface to the XTF framework. For searches, it allows you to use Ruby to generate XML queries for XTF's RawQuery servlet which then responds with XTF's raw XML response. 

=== Status of Code

Currently, the search section of the library is robust and employed in a production environment. For results, XTF-Ruby provides an API for parsing XTF's raw XML results into Ruby objects. This area is currently a work-in-progress, as I extract the code from a project for generalized use.
